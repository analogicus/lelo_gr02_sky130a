The operational amplifier used within the bandgap circuit is shown in the figure above. It consists of an NMOS differential input pair combined with a PMOS current mirror load to provide amplification. Below the differential stage, a simple NMOS current mirror is used as a current source. A 32 kΩ resistor generates the bias current required to properly drive the op-amp. Power gating for the op-amp is implemented using PMOS transistors located above the circuit.
